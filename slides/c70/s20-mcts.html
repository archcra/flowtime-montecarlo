  The basic MCTS is conceptually very simple.  A tree is build in an incremental and asymmetric
manner.  Each iteration of MCTS consists of four steps:
•
Selection:  Begin with some root
R
, a
tree policy
is used to find the most urgent child of
R
, then we successively select child till we reach a leaf
L
.
•
Expansion:  Unless the node
L
ends game, create one or more node of
L
and pick one of
them, call it
C
.
•
Simulation:  play random playouts from
C
.
•
Backpropagation:  Update the information of the nodes in the path from
C
to
R
using the
result of the random playouts.
