  They recommend to choose in each node of the game tree the
move, for which the expression<br>
（公式请见右上）<br>
has the highest value, where wi is the number of of wins after the ith move, ni is the number of simulations after the
ith move, c is the exploration parameter which theoretically equal to √2.
t is the total number of simulations, equal to the sum of all ni.  These steps are summarized in the following pseudocode in Algorithm 1(Original MCTS):

</p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-python">
function MCTSearch(s0)
  create root node v0 with state s0.
  while within computational budget do
    vl ← TreePolicy(v0)
    ∆  ← Simulate(s(vl))
    Backprog(∆, vl)

  return Bestchild(v0)
</code></pre>
<p>
  where textitBestchild leads to the best child of the root node v0.
