<strong>
4. Backpropagation
</strong>
<p>
Walk back up the tree to the root. On each statistics node, increment a “visit” count. Also, increment a “win” count if the current player of game node that’s the parent of the current game node is the player that won the simulation.
</p>
<p>
Then you repeat the four steps as many times as you can, until you’ve either decided you’ve done enough work or you run out of time.
You pick the move that ends up at the child node with the win/visit count ratio.
