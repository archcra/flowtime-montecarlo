<strong>
2. Expansion
</strong>
<p>
Create a statistics node for the node you stopped at in the selection phase. It appears that most implementations will also force the expansion of all the children of a node once a nodeâ€™s visit count reaches some threshold. One implementation I found used a threshold of 30.

<strong>
3. Simulation
</strong>
<p>
Simulate or roll out a game starting from the node you created in the expansion phase. You basically play a game to the end,
choosing moves randomly (or semi-randomly). At the end, you keep track of which player won and then move to the backpropagation phase.
