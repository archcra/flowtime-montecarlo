<strong>1. Selection</strong>
<p>
Walk down the game tree using a selection function at each node to determine which child node to walk to next. Stop when you reach a node that you don’t have statistics for yet.

The selection function most commonly used is called UCT and is as follows(右上角图):
</p>
<pre>
  Where:

    wi stands for the number of wins after the ith move
    ni stands for the number of simulations after the ith move
    c is the exploration parameter. sqrt(2) is a good first guess for this number, but in practice, you’ll have to tune it experimentally.
    t stands for the total number of simulations, equal to the sum of all ni. Or, another way to think about this is that it’s the ni of the parent node

You then select the child node that the highest selection function value.
