  AlphaGo's 4-1 victory in Seoul, South Korea, in March 2016 was watched by over 200 million people worldwide.
  It was a landmark achievement that experts agreed was a decade ahead of its time, and earned AlphaGo a 9 dan professional
  ranking - the first time a computer Go player had ever received the accolade.
