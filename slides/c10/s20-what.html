  What is Monte Carlo Simulation?</a> </h1>
<p>
  The Monte Carlo method was invented by scientists working on the atomic bomb in the 1940s, who named it for the city in Monaco famed for its casinos and games of chance.  Its core idea is to use random samples of parameters or inputs to explore the behavior of a complex system or process.

  The scientists faced physics problems, such as models of neutron diffusion, that were too complex for an analytical solution -- so they had to be evaluated numerically.  They had access to one of the earliest computers -- MANIAC -- but their models involved so many dimensions that exhaustive numerical evaluation was prohibitively slow.  Monte Carlo simulation proved to be surprisingly effective at finding solutions to these problems.  Since that time, Monte Carlo methods have been applied to an incredibly diverse range of problems in science, engineering, and finance -- and business applications in virtually every industry.
