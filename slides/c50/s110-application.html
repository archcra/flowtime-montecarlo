Design and visuals

Monte Carlo methods are also efficient in solving coupled integral differential equations of radiation fields and
energy transport, and thus these methods have been used in global illumination computations that produce
photo-realistic images of virtual 3D models, with applications in video games, architecture, design, computer
generated films, and cinematic special effects.
Search and rescue

The US Coast Guard utilizes Monte Carlo methods within its computer modeling software SAROPS in order to calculate
the probable locations of vessels during search and rescue operations. Each simulation can generate as many as ten
thousand data points which are randomly distributed based upon provided variables. Search patterns are then
generated based upon extrapolations of these data in order to optimize the probability of containment (POC) and the
 probability of detection (POD), which together will equal an overall probability of success (POS). Ultimately this
  serves as a practical application of probability distribution in order to provide the swiftest and most expedient
   method of rescue, saving both lives and resources.
