<strong>  Monte Carlo methods are widely used in engineering for sensitivity analysis and quantitative probabilistic analysis in process design. The need arises from the interactive, co-linear and non-linear behavior of typical process simulations. For example,

In microelectronics engineering, Monte Carlo methods are applied to analyze correlated and uncorrelated variations in analog and digital integrated circuits.
In geostatistics and geometallurgy, Monte Carlo methods underpin the design of mineral processing flowsheets and contribute to quantitative risk analysis.
In wind energy yield analysis, the predicted energy output of a wind farm during its lifetime is calculated giving different levels of uncertainty (P90, P50, etc.)
impacts of pollution are simulated and diesel compared with petrol.
In fluid dynamics, in particular rarefied gas dynamics, where the Boltzmann equation is solved for finite Knudsen number fluid flows using the direct
simulation Monte Carlo  method in combination with highly efficient computational algorithms.
In autonomous robotics, Monte Carlo localization can determine the position of a robot. It is often applied to stochastic filters such as the Kalman filter or
particle filter that forms the heart of the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) algorithm.
In telecommunications, when planning a wireless network, design must be proved to work for a wide variety of scenarios that depend mainly on the number of users,
their locations and the services they want to use. Monte Carlo methods are typically used to generate these users and their states. The network performance is
then evaluated and, if results are not satisfactory, the network design goes through an optimization process.
In reliability engineering, one can use Monte Carlo simulation to generate mean time between failures and mean time to repair for components.
In signal processing and Bayesian inference, particle filters and sequential Monte Carlo techniques are a class of mean field particle methods for sampling and
computing the posterior distribution of a signal process given some noisy and partial observations using interacting empirical measures.
