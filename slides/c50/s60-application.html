<h1> Application - Climate change and radiative forcing </a></h1>

<strong>
</strong>

<pre style="font-size:1em;">
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change relies on Monte Carlo methods in probability density function
analysis of radiative forcing.

  Probability density function (PDF) of ERF due to total GHG, aerosol forcing and total anthropogenic forcing.
  The GHG consists of WMGHG, ozone and stratospheric water vapour. The PDFs are generated based on
  uncertainties provided in Table 8.6. The combination of the individual RF agents to derive total forcing
  over the Industrial Era are done by Monte Carlo simulations and based on the method in Boucher and
  Haywood (2001). PDF of the ERF from surface albedo changes and combined contrails and contrail-induced cirrus
  are included in the total anthropogenic forcing, but not shown as a separate PDF. We currently do not have
  ERF estimates for some forcing mechanisms: ozone, land use, solar, etc.
