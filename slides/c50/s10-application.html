<h1> The Monte Carlo Method - History</a></h1>

<p>
  Before the Monte Carlo method was developed, simulations tested a previously understood deterministic problem, and statistical sampling was used to estimate uncertainties in the simulations. Monte Carlo simulations invert this approach, solving deterministic problems using a probabilistic analog

    An early variant of the Monte Carlo method can be seen in the Buffon's needle experiment(布豐投針問題), in which π can be estimated by dropping needles on a floor made of parallel and equidistant strips.


    The a needle lies across a line, while the b needle does not.

A quick experiment to estimate π, yielding the value of 34/11≈3.1 based on 17 throws.
